# About

A version of the comment section uploaded before (challenge from Frontend Mentor), but now made interactive. It is still a frontend app, although it's imitating CRUD functionality through the utilization
of the local storage.

## Purpose

The goal with the previous version was to only clone the design presented in the challenge on Frontend Mentor. This time by adding interactivity, the code is more complex and includes usage 
of React's Context API and other additional functions / utilities as data is now dynamic rather than the fetched json file last time. In addition to Tailwind CSS, Flowbite React was used to include a modal,
the design of which was cloned to look like in the challenge.
